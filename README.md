# url-to-qr-image

This is a sample Chrome extension project built with **Manifest Version 3**.  
It demonstrates how to create the barebones of a Chrome extension and how to add custom functionality — in this example, generating QR codes for the current tab.

## Features demonstrated

1. Creating the basic structure of a Chrome extension  
2. Adding functionality to generate QR codes for the current tab:
   - Display in the extension's popup window, or
   - Display directly in the current tab  

This project uses the [neocotic/qrious](https://github.com/neocotic/qrious) library to generate the QR codes, but you can replace it with any custom feature you want to add.
